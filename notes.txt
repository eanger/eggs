Restructure the game data as members in tables (in sqlite??):
    'Entities'      - one row per entity, one column per entity info (position, texture, type(?))
    'Workers'       - one row per worker, has a key into entities table, but lets you query for tasks. maybe a cur_taskID column?
    'Tasks'         - list of things the user wants to do. build this, destroy that
    'Collidables'   - list of things which undergo collision and pathfinding
    'Textures'      - all textures used for rendering. some way for animated textures (ie texture sets)?

Should this include stuff like user input?
