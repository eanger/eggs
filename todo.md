# Quick things
* Keep huge matrix of locations with every unit at each location -> simplifies lookup

# Bigger Tasks
* Button (pressed, or clickable) that opens up menu of buildables. Click to place buildable.
* Person entity that has an AI
* Placing an object requires a person to build
* Event queue managing when people request being moved, how long it takes to make things, etc
* Allow scrolling or ctrl-= / ctrl-- to zoom in and out (bounded on the high and low end)
